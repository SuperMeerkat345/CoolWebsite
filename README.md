Instructions:
In the programming assignments folder you should find the programming assignments and their respective instructions.
Do a couple units of codecademy in javascript and do the programming assignments as practice. 
Submit the programming assignment with your name in the programming assignment folder once finished (I will check them later).

If you feel comfortable with javascript, start this course on html:

In case you want to test out building a website without having to create a seperate project and all that hooligantry, use this online editor:

Once you have gotten familiar with html I want you to do programming assignment number 4.
