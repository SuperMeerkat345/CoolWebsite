FIRST OFF: MAKE SURE YOU RUN "git pull" IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE CHANGES IN THIS REPOSITORY

Instructions:
In the programming assignments folder you should find the programming assignments and their respective instructions.
Do a couple units of codecademy in javascript and do the programming assignments as practice. 
Submit the programming assignment with your name in the programming assignment folder once finished (I will check them later).

If you feel comfortable with javascript, start this course on html:

In case you want to test out building a website without having to create a seperate project and all that hooligantry, use this online editor:

I want you guys to get really familiar with Javascript as it is the most versatile language for web development, but you also need to know how to use HTML, and CSS which isn't as important so we'll learn later.
