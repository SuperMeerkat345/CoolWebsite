PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 4:
This programming assignment is based on pure HTML.
I do not expect you to use any CSS or JavaScript code since this is a beginner assignemnt.
Later on you guys will collaborate on a website so this is sort of an introductory exercise to building them.

I want you to create a simple "About Me" webpage that includes the following elements:

1. A title for the webpage that says "About Me".
2. A heading that introduces yourself (e.g., "Hello, I'm [Your Name]!"). 
3. A paragraph that provides a brief introduction about yourself, including your hobbies and interests.
4. An unordered list of at least three of your favorite books, movies, or activities.
5. An image that represents you or something you like (make sure to use a valid image URL).
6. A footer that includes your contact information (e.g., email address).

KEEP IN MIND:
This is for fun so I don't care what you actually write about yourself. 
You could even say that you beat up aaron for fun if you want to.
The point is to practice HTML structure.


EXTRA CREDIT:
If you want to, you can use a bit of css to spice up your webpage.
Change the background color, font style, or add borders to your image.
